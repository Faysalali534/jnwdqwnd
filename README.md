# AdTech Real-Time Event Tracking Pipeline

This project implements a scalable, production-grade, real-time event tracking pipeline on Google Cloud Platform. It is designed to handle high-volume event ingestion, processing, and analytics for AdTech applications.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This pipeline is designed to address the challenges of tracking and analyzing millions of daily events from various sources, such as website pixels, server-side webhooks, and third-party advertising platforms like Meta and Google Ads.

### Key Features:
- **Cloud-Native & Serverless:** Built entirely on GCP, leveraging serverless components like Cloud Run and Cloud Functions for scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Events are processed and made available for analytics in near real-time.
- **Scalable & Decoupled:** The architecture is designed to handle high throughput and is decoupled using Pub/Sub to ensure reliability.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All infrastructure is managed using Terraform for reproducibility and version control.
- **CI/CD Automation:** Deployment is fully automated with GitHub Actions.
- **Modular Data Modeling:** Data transformations are managed with dbt for maintainability and data quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To deploy this project, you will need:
- A Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled.
- A service account with appropriate permissions (`roles/owner` for simplicity, or more granular permissions for production).
- A GitHub repository with secrets configured for `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_SA_KEY`.
- A ClickHouse Cloud account and API credentials.

Once the prerequisites are met, pushing to the `main` branch will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and deploy the entire pipeline.
